<h1>Dimensionality reduction in predicting psychodemographic features</h1>
<h2>Kosinski's Facebook User-Like predictions in scikit-learn</h2>

In this project I'll try to recreate some of the results of “Mining Big Data to Extract Patterns and Predict Real-Life Outcomes” article by Michal Kosinski, Yilun Wang, Himabindu Lakkaraju, and Jure Leskovec published in Psychological Methods in 2016 using Machine Learning tools I've learned.

Big Data is here to stay. It gives us insights not only about weather, traffic, software operations, but also about ourselves. Every comment we make online (or even react to), every Like on Facebook, Retweet on Twitter, or Amazon transaction reveal something about the user. Usefulness of those insights has been proven not only in e-commerce (ads, recommendation systems), but also in politics (most notably 2016 Trump and Brexit campaigns). 

Sample dataset is not a part of this repository, but you can find it here: https://www.michalkosinski.com/data-mining-tutorial
